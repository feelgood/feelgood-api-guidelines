# Feelgood's API Guidelines

This is the repository for [Feelgood's pragmatic and practical guidelines for REST-fullish HTTP/JSON API:s](feelgood-api-guidelines.md).

> Good fences make good neighbors

## Background and purpose

Feelgood's software architecture is based on microservice API:s, BFF API:s and external API:s for partners and, in the future, for customers. We like HTTP, JSON, KISS and clean and simple interfaces.

## Usage

These guidelines are used by Feelgood's development teams, but should be of interest to partners and customers. If others have use or find inspiration here, great! We update and revise these guidelines when the need arises. Feedback is appreciated. Contact: `paul dot cohen at feelgood dot se`.
